-- Refactor / Restructure 

+ preprocessing
    + cutting SRLG-s into a sep. file for each list
    + dual graph into a sep. file (calc. of dual into a sep module)

+ logging 
    + metrics in a better way
    + better separated debugging / info code segments 

+ tasks
    + k=2 basecase :: ONly take the clockwise side of SRLGs into account 
    + implement min-cut algorithm 
    + deal with primal-dual connected srlgs 
    + check if the solution still works with the ommitance of the "right-of" path constraint 
        ~(it may be implemented in this way already)
